# School District Analysis
## Overview
After the completion of the first school district analysis, it was discovered that there was evidence of academic dishonesty. In particular, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. In order to uphold state-testing standards, the decision was made to replace the ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once those scores were replaced, the entire overall analysis needed to be repeated.
